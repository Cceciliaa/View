This is an interactive Web Comic project, showing in a first-person perspective. The main character in this comic is going on a tour, but instead of enjoying the natural view, he/she spends most of the time on his/her cellphone, browsing social media platforms. Ironically, the posts happens to be pictures taken at the same places that he/she is traveling through. It was not until a stanger interrupted the main character for a fabvor to take a photo did he/she realize the beauty of the surrounding view. He/she then decided to put down his/her cellphone and travel back to the places he/she visited earlier, enjoyinng the best view that nature can offer.

The ways of interaction in this project are mainly scrolling and clicking. In the first part, users can scroll down the screen of the cellphone to see the posts and changes in the background. For the second part, users can click on the arrows in the bottom cornors to "revisit" the sites without the cellphone blocking the view.

I collaborated with another student on this project. We together decided for the contents and flow of the project, and while she took charge of the paintings, I worked on all of the coding part.
